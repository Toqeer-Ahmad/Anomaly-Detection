# Anomaly Detection
In this project, we will implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
<br />

## Packages used in this project:
- numpy is the fundamental package for working with matrices in Python.
- matplotlib is a famous library to plot graphs in Python.
- utils.py contains helper functions for this assignment. You do not need to modify code in this file.

## Source
Source file is available in the files section or can be accessed [here](https://github.com/Toqeer-Ahmad/Anomaly-Detection/blob/main/08-Anomaly%20Detection.ipynb)

## Outcome
Successful use of the Gaussian distribution for anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
